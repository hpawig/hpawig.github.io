In STAT 541, we learned about creating an interactive dashboard with Quarto and Shiny. 
We used the Wellcome Global Monitor survey report and data from 2018 [^1] and from 2020[^2].
I implemented some of my plots from my Lab 2: Advanced Visualizations and Lab 3: Static Dashboards.

This interactive dashboard was published online with shinyapps.io. Embedded below is the website, 
which has a lot of the features learned with static dashboards but with the addition of 
user input options.
