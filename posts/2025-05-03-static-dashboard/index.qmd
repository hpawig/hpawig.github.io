In STAT 541, we learned about creating a static dashboard using Quarto. 
We used the Wellcome Global Monitor survey report and data from 2018 [^1], 
and I implemented some of my plots from our Lab 2: Advanced Visualizations.

My static dashboard was published online using *Quarto Pub*. Embedded below is the website, which includes
usage of card tabsets, pages, and navigation bar options!
