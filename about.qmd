# Who am I, Hannah Pawig?

## Right now
I am a fourth year student at California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo, California. I am majoring Statistics with a minor in Ethnic Studies.

## Background
I am from Clovis, California. I have always had an appreciation for math growing up, and it being
my best subject also played a part in my decision to pursue a degree in Statistics. My overarching goal with my academics is to contribute to a data-informed world. I want to be able to use my knowledge of statistics to help people and organizations make informed decisions based on data. I am particularly interested in the intersection of statistics and health.
